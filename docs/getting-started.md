# Getting Started

## Group Chat
We use [Gitter](https://gitter.im) to discuss JavaScript, [Projects](projects.html) and share useful [Resources](resources.html). Create a [github](https://github.com/) account and [join in](https://gitter.im/CodeHubOrg/discussions)!

## Books
If you are new to JavaScript [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is an excellent introduction to JavaScript with online exercises.

* [You don't know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)
* [Secrets of the Javascript Ninja](https://www.manning.com/books/secrets-of-the-javascript-ninja)
* [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.cartipdf.net/carte/descarca-hunt-a-thomas-d-the-pragmatic-programmer-from-journeyman-to-master-pdf)
* [Clean Code](http://ricardogeek.com/docs/clean_code.pdf)

## Code Editors
We recommend planning your work with pencil and paper.  Browser based playgrounds such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) are great for trying things out.  There are many text editors to choose from such as [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Vim](www.vim.org/) (look mum no mouse!).  If you have a large complex project an IDE such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) might be more appropriate. If you want to do some remote pair programming, we have found [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to be a very good tool for that. It allows you to set up and deploy an app easily, and can import from, and export to, a Git repo.

## Online Courses
You might find working through an online course helpful.  [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) is a group favourite and is the most [starred project](https://github.com/search?q=stars:%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories) on github at time of writing.

Other options include:
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
* [Tree House](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/topic:javascript)
* [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-basics--ud804)
* [Introduction to Programming Course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-9) with MIT on Edx.

## Frameworks
You might be interested in learning a JavaScript framework.  We recommend getting to grips with JavaScript basics first.  As a group we are mainly interested in learning [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/
) (@todo more about React).

## Projects
A great way to learn JavaScript is to make a passion project.  

Passion Projects are a creative side projects. Theyâ€™re connected to your deeper meaning and they have tangible outcomes. It's a great way to learn whether it's your first component, website or mobile app.

You might like to get involved and contribute to one of our own projects. Find out more on our [Projects page](projects.html).

## Command Line
[Learning the command line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) allows you utilize powerful tools and manage projects.

## Package Management
We recommend installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install packages and run workshops.

## Source Control
Source control allows you to manage versions of your code and contribute to projects.  We use [git](https://git-scm.com/) and host our projects on [github](https://github.com/CodeHubOrg).  A good practical Introduction is the [node school](https://nodeschool.io/) workshop which can be installed and run with the following commands:

```
npm install -g git-it
git-it
```
In order to contribute to a project you should learn [how to use git](/getting-started/git) and [how to make a pull request](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12XPsgBkarJLA6I1UJd7HK1izUpQfX2Lt2gQq91z9XNQ/edit#slide=id.p).

## Further Resources
It's particularly important with Javascipt to make sure the resources you're using are up to date... a resource that's just a couple of years old can be way out of date; Javascript frameworks and methods are evolving rapidly.

Find out about the best and most up to date resources on our [Resources page](resources.html).

## Next step
Check out our [Roadmaps](/roadmap) page with some advice on integrating your goals with those of the group.
